## DeCCed Card Builder
**DeCCed** /d…õkt/ was created as part of the Christmas Chaos project.  I knew I did not want to have to manage updating hundreds of cards in layout editors, etc, as I made revisions and that I had no easy way to merge data files in the programs I had available.  I had used SVG in my professional work and had a pretty good understanding of how to navigate its XML files.  I figured since SVG is just XML, I should be able to just modify the XML directly, which is just what I did.  **DeCCed** is just the De"Christmas Chaos"ed version of this utility.
